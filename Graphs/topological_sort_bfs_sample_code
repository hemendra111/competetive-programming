/* bfs based topological implementation by  Kahn */

enqueue vertices with zero incoming degree into a (priority) queue Q;
while (Q is not empty) {
	vertex u = Q.dequeue(); put vertex u into a topological sort list;
	remove this vertex u and all outgoing edges from this vertex;
	if such removal causes vertex v to have zero incoming degree
	Q.enqueue(v);
}
